# What is slip2tun ?

This program allows you to plug a Serial Line IP (SLIP) connection into OSX's network stack.
In a way it is similar to `slattach` under Linux.

# Installation

This program requires a [kernel extension](http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net/) to allow the creation of virtual network interfaces.
You can then install it by running `sudo python3 setup.py install`.

# Usage

See `slip2tun -h` for usage information.
